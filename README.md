# installation and play

Open Unity and start Scene 0. Use your mouse to pull back a projectile and fire it at the castles!

# motivation

I am going through Jeremy Gibson's <i>Game Design, Prototyping, and Development</i> textbook and building the prototypes he gives the reader to do. This is the third prototype.
