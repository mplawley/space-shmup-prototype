# installation and play

Open Unity and start Scene 0. Use the arrow keys or wasd to move and spacebar to fire at the enemies! Pick up powerups and level up your weapons.

# motivation

I am going through Jeremy Gibson's <i>Game Design, Prototyping, and Development</i> textbook and building the prototypes he gives the reader to do. This is the third prototype.
